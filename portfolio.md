  - project:
    title: AM Tower Locator
    role: I am responsible for all development. I'm using jQuery to query an FCC API to get all AM Towers within a 3km radius of the lat/long entered by the user. I then perform calculations on that data to determine if interference is possible and present that results. The results are presented using mustache templates with the base map being called from the FCC's Mapbox account and the markers added using mapbox.js.

    title: Competition Report

    title: Mobile Broadband Providers
    role: I was responsible for all development and UI work. I also converted shapefile and excel data in json, machine-readable, to be used as an API. I then used jQuery to query the data and mustache templates to present the results. The results are also available in json format and will soon be mapped using geojson and leaflet.js with a Mapbox base.

    title: Signal Boosters
    role: I was responsible for front end development along with some backend, PHP and MySQL, development. This application will allow licensees to register their signal boosters and allow the public to search the boosters to locate them in case interference is caused. A highlight I developed <strong>a new way for the FCC to accept good data by mapping the input provided, as it's provided</strong>. This method is soon to be implemented in ULS.
